# Production-Grade Authentication with Hono & Better Auth

A simple Todo application demonstrating a full, secure authentication system built with modern tools.

## Overview

This project shows how to build a **production-ready authentication layer** using **Hono**, **Better Auth**, and **Mailgun**, layered over a very basic todo app. The idea is to show how authentication (signup, login, email verification, session handling) works in a real-world context.

## Tech Stack

* Bun — runtime
* Hono — web framework
* Better Auth — authentication & authorization logic
* Mailgun — for email sending (verification, magic links, password reset)
* PostgreSQL — database
* Drizzle — ORM
* Zod — input / schema validation
* TypeScript — the superman
